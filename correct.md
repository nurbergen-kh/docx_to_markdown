# REQUEST FOR EXPRESSION OF INTEREST (EOI)

Calls for expression of interest (EOI) – in French *"appels à manifestation d’intérêt"* (AMI) – serve to invite economic operators to put themselves forward as candidates in advance of a public procurement operation by a contracting authority. The shortlists generated this way may be used and updated many times for different procurement procedures.

The purpose of this EOI is to provide the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD or the Organisation) with a list of candidates who will be invited to participate to the upcoming Call for Tenders/Market Consultations for intellectual services in support of MOPAN’s assessments of multilateral organisations and analytical studies.

Applicants can be individuals, companies, cabinets or any entity authorised to perform the contract under applicable national law, i.e. by way of inclusion in a trade or professional register or sworn declaration or certificate, membership of a specific organisation, express authorisation or entry in the VAT register.

The Call for Tenders/Market Consultations will be published on the eSourcing Portal of the OECD:  
[https://dashboard.prospeum.com/#/login/onboarding/oecd](https://dashboard.prospeum.com/#/login/onboarding/oecd).

Calls for Tenders are open for participation to all the interested and eligible parties who will register to the Portal. Market Consultations are accessible only by invitation.

Once they are registered on the eSourcing Portal, the candidates will be informed of any other tender launched on the Portal, and in connection with activities related to the areas of expertise that they have selected.

Interested applicants are asked to fill in and submit the standard application form. Submissions may start from the date of publication on the OECD website.
